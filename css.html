        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation
        of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes
        how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.

        <h1 class="text-responsive" id="h1tag">What is CSS?</h1>
        <h4>
            <strong>The Cascading stylesheat is to style your webpage/website.It has various Stylings and various new
                features.
                <br>
                <br>
                And Every year they add new features. </strong>
            <br>
            The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more
            than
            one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.

            The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME
            type)
            text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation
            service
            for CSS documents.[5]

                <h1>History Of CSS</h1>
                The saga of CSS starts in 1994. Håkon Wium Lie works at CERN – the cradle of the Web – and the Web is
                starting to be used as a platform for electronic publishing. One crucial part of a publishing platform
                is
                missing, however: There is no way to style documents. For example, there is no way to describe a
                newspaper-like layout in a Web page. Having worked on personalized newspaper presentations at the MIT
                Media
                Laboratory, Håkon saw the need for a style sheet language for the Web.

                Style sheets in browsers were not an entirely new idea. The separation of document structure from the
                document's layout had been a goal of HTML from its inception in 1990. Tim Berners-Lee wrote his NeXT
                browser/editor in such a way that he could determine the style with a simple style sheet. However, he
                didn't
                publish the syntax for the style sheets, considering it a matter for each browser to decide how to best
                display pages to its users. In 1992, Pei Wei developed a browser called Viola, which had its own style
                sheet
                language.

                However, the browsers that followed offered their users fewer and fewer options to influence the style.
                In
                1993, NCSA Mosaic, the browser that made the Web popular, came out. Stylewise, however, it was a
                backward
                step because it only allowed its users to change certain colors and fonts.

                Meanwhile, writers of Web pages complained that they didn't have enough influence over how their pages
                looked. One of the first questions from an author new to the Web was how to change fonts and colors of
                elements. At that time, HTML did not provide this functionality – and rightfully so. This excerpt from a
                message sent to the www-talk mailing list early in 1994 gives a sense of the tensions between authors
                and
                implementors:

                <aside>

                    In fact, it has been a constant source of delight for me over
                    the past year to get to continually tell hordes (literally) of
                    people who want to -- strap yourselves in, here it comes --
                    control what their documents look like in ways that would be
                    trivial in TeX, Microsoft Word, and every other common text
                    processing environment: "Sorry, you're screwed."

                        American computer
                        scientist.[1] He created the C programming language and, with long-time colleague Ken Thompson,
                        the
                        Unix operating system and B programming language.[1] Ritchie and Thompson were awarded the

                        Award from the ACM in 1983, the Hamming Medal from the IEEE in 1990 and the National Medal of
                        Technology from President Bill Clinton in 1999. Ritchie was the head of Lucent Technologies

                        <h2>Dennis Ritchie's Personal Life And Carrier</h2>
                        <b>Dennis Ritchie was born in Bronxville, New York. His father was Alistair E. Ritchie, a
                            longtime Bell Labs scientist and co-author of The Design of Switching Circuits[7] on
                            switching circuit theory.[8] As a child, Dennis moved with his family to Summit, New Jersey,
                            where he graduated from Summit High School.[9] He graduated from Harvard University with
                            degrees in physics and applied mathematics.[8]</b>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <i>In 1967, Ritchie began working at the Bell Labs Computing Sciences Research Center, and in
                            1968, he defended his PhD thesis on "Computational Complexity and Program Structure" at
                            Harvard under the supervision of Patrick C. Fischer. However, Ritchie never officially
                            received his PhD degree as he did not submit a bound copy of his dissertation to the Harvard
                            library, a requirement for the degree.[10][11] In 2020, the Computer History museum worked
                            with Ritchie's family and Fischer's family and found a copy of the lost
                            dissertation.[11]</i><span><img

                        <br>
                        During the 1960s, Ritchie and Ken Thompson worked on the Multics operating system at Bell Labs.
                        Thompson then found an old PDP-7 machine and developed his own application programs and
                        operating system from scratch, aided by Ritchie and others. In 1970, Brian Kernighan suggested
                        the name "Unix", a pun on the name "Multics".[12] To supplement assembly language with a
                        system-level programming language, Thompson created B. Later, B was replaced by C, created by
                        Ritchie, who continued to contribute to the development of Unix and C for many years.[13]
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        During the 1970s, Ritchie collaborated with James Reeds and Robert Morris on a ciphertext-only
                        attack on the M-209 US cipher machine that could solve messages of at least 2000–2500
                        letters.[14] Ritchie relates that, after discussions with the National Security Agency, the
                        authors decided not to publish it, as they were told that the principle was applicable to
                        machines still in use by foreign governments.[14]

                        Ritchie was also involved with the development of the Plan 9 and Inferno operating systems, and
                        the programming language Limbo.

                        As part of an AT&T restructuring in the mid-1990s, Ritchie was transferred to Lucent
                        Technologies, where he retired in 2007 as head of System Software Research Department.[15]

                        Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (née Byron; 10 December 1815 – 27 November 1852) was an
                        English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed
                        mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognise that
                        the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and to have published the first algorithm
                        intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is often regarded as the first
                        computer programmer.[2][3][4]
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Ada Byron was the only child of poet Lord Byron and mathematician Lady Byron.[5] All of Byron's
                        other children were born out of wedlock to other women.[6] Byron separated from his wife a month
                        after Ada was born and left England forever. Four months later, he commemorated the parting in a
                        poem that begins, "Is thy face like thy mother's my fair child! ADA! sole daughter of my house
                        and heart?".[7] He died in Greece when Ada was eight years old. Her mother remained bitter and
                        promoted Ada's interest in mathematics and logic in an effort to prevent her from developing her
                        father's perceived insanity. Despite this, Ada remained interested in him, naming her two sons
                        Byron and Gordon. Upon her death, she was buried next to him at her request. Although often ill
                        in her childhood, Ada pursued her studies assiduously. She married William King in 1835. King
                        was made Earl of Lovelace in 1838, Ada thereby becoming Countess of Lovelace.

                        Her educational and social exploits brought her into contact with scientists such as Andrew
                        Crosse, Charles Babbage, Sir David Brewster, Charles Wheatstone, Michael Faraday and the author
                        Charles Dickens, contacts which she used to further her education. Ada described her approach as
                        "poetical science"[8] and herself as an "Analyst (& Metaphysician)".[9]

                        When she was a teenager (18), her mathematical talents led her to a long working relationship
                        and friendship with fellow British mathematician Charles Babbage, who is known as "the father of
                        computers". She was in particular interested in Babbage's work on the Analytical Engine.
                        Lovelace first met him in June 1833, through their mutual friend, and her private tutor, Mary
                        Somerville.

                        Between 1842 and 1843, Ada translated an article by Italian military engineer Luigi Menabrea
                        about the Analytical Engine, supplementing it with an elaborate set of notes, simply called
                        "Notes". Lovelace's notes are important in the early history of computers, containing what many
                        consider to be the first computer program—that is, an algorithm designed to be carried out by a
                        machine. Other historians reject this perspective and point out that Babbage's personal notes
                        from the years 1836/1837 contain the first programs for the engine.[10] She also developed a
                        vision of the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or number-crunching, while
                        many others, including Babbage himself, focused only on those capabilities.[11] Her mindset of
                        "poetical science" led her to ask questions about the Analytical Engine (as shown in her notes)
                        examining how individuals and society relate to technology as a collaborative tool.[6]

                        She died of uterine cancer in 1852 at the age of 36, the same age at which her father died.

                        <h1>Biography Of Gennady Korotkevich</h1>
                        Korotkevich was born in Gomel (Homiel), southeastern Belarus. His parents, Vladimir and Lyudmila
                        Korotkevich, are programmers in the mathematics department at Francysk Skaryna Homiel State
                        University. At age 6, he became interested in his parents' work. When he was 8, his father
                        designed a children's game he could use to learn programming.[7]

                        His mother consulted departmental colleague Mikhail Dolinsky, who gave Korotkevich a small book
                        to read. Dolinsky, one of the top computer science teachers in Belarus, recalled, "A month went
                        by, and then another one... No news from Gena. Then suddenly Lyudmila comes by and brings me a
                        programming notebook: when summer and football were over, her son sat at the computer. As a
                        second-grader at a national competition, he took second place, which gained him an automatic
                        entry into a technical university without taking any entrance exams. Somehow he solved the
                        problem of a body immersed in water. At that time, Gena didn't even know about Archimedes'
                        principle of buoyancy."[7]

                        Korotkevich first gained global attention when he qualified for the 2006 International Olympiad
                        in Informatics (IOI) at the age of 11, a world record by a large margin.[8]

                        He took the silver medal at his first IOI event and received gold medals from 2007 to 2012. To
                        date, he is the most successful competitor in IOI's history.[9]

                        At the 2009 IOI in Plovdiv, the then 14-year-old Korotkevich said of his success, "I try various
                        [strategies], and one of them is the right one. I am no genius. I am simply good at it." He said
                        he spent no more than three to four hours each day at the computer, and his preferred hobbies
                        are football and table tennis.[10]

                        In the fall of 2012, he moved to Russia to attend ITMO University. In the summer of 2013, he
                        helped ITMO defeat Shanghai Jiao Tong University and the University of Tokyo to win the 37th
                        International Collegiate Programming Contest World Finals, held in St. Petersburg.[11] He also
                        won the annual Google Code Jam from 2014 to 2020.

                        In a 2014 interview, Korotkevich said he was unsure of his career plans after graduation, saying
                        he'd focus on his education and possibly go into science.[8]

                        In a 2017 interview, Korotkevich said he had received job offers from Google and Yandex, but
                        that he had turned them down and would instead continue with his degree in computer science at
                        ITMO.[12]

                        In 2019, Korotkevich was a PhD student at ITMO.[13]
